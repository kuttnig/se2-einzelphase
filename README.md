# SE2-EINZELPHASE
This repository contains an implementation of a small Android-application for the course "Software Engineering 2"
## Important note
I implemented two different versions of the app. Please consider the result on branch **se2** as my implementation for this exercise.
## Short description of the features
This app contains a small textfield where you can enter a number. There are also two buttons. When the first button is pressed, the entered number is send to a server and the response is displayed within a textview. If the second button is pressed the number is passed to a function which computes a result based on the given rules of the exercise. If the calcutation is finished the result gets displayed within the textview.
